## üéØ How It Works

![MultiPDF Chat App Diagram](img/Architecture.jpg)

### Steps for Response Generation:

1. **PDF Loading**: Extract text content from uploaded PDF documents.
2. **Text Chunking**: Divide extracted text into manageable chunks for processing.
3. **Language Model Integration**: Generate vector representations (embeddings) of text chunks using LLMs.
4. **Similarity Matching**: Compare your question with text chunks to find the most relevant ones.
5. **Response Generation**: Provide an accurate, contextually relevant response based on the identified chunks.
